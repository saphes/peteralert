# peter alert
i saw this cool thing called peter alert and recreated it in go
because i was bored

original can be found [here](https://github.com/kokoscript/PeterAlert)

## how to build
make sure you have go installed (i used go 1.23.3) and run
`go build -o peteralert .`
(or if ur a windows user)
`go build -o peteralert.exe .`
this will make a binary that you can then run

## problems it has
- it relies on the original `kokoscript/PeterAlert` repository for the peter image
- my version is bad
